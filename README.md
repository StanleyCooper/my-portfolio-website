# My Portfolio Website

Hello! My name is S. Lucas Cooper and this is the repo for my portfolio website.

The purpose of this website is to bring together various projects I create in order to display them all in one easy to find location. I want to instil my personality into this project, and create something that truly feels like my own. This is why I have decided to create a portfolio website from scatch. To show off my own skills, while also giving myself full creative responsibility over this space.

Due to being an indecisive person, I'm sure this website will undergo various layout and stylistic changes throughout its lifetime. Please bear with me throughout this process!
