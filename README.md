# My-Portfolio-Website

The goal with this project was to create a working portofio website to hold all
my information on projects and blog posts in one place. 

While creating this site, I wanted to challenge myself by limiting the use of any
frameworks (outside of React and icons), while maintaining and professional looking UI.

I learned a lot through making this site, and I plan to continually update it as I continue my journey as a web developer.

## Installation Instructions

At the moment, this site is **not** deployed. 

To see a function build, fork and clone this repository into a new folder and run:
```npm install```
once finished installing, run:
```npm start```

## Technologies Used

The technology stacks used in this project were:
- React.js
- React Router Dom
- HTML5
- CSS3
- MaterialUI/icons

## Planned Updates

Outside of filling this portfolio with real projects and blog posts, I plan to add the following to this website:

- Projects page with detailed information on completed and ongoing projects
- AboutMe page with more personable information about myself
- Contact page with proper information on how to reach me
- Stylization and animation changes with vanilla css
- Code cleanups and refractoring
- Dark mode accessible with a working toggle
